# Guidance for Collaborators: How to Edit

If you are a collaborator and you'd like to make changes to the website, please follow this guide.



> [!NOTE]
> If you need to make larger edits, consider setting up a branch first. This means you can commit your changes without them going live. Run `git switch -c <your-branch-name>`, make your changes, and then merge with main.

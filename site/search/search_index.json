After retraining in medicine, I completed core and higher training in psychiatry as an NIHR academic clinical fellow, then lecturer. I'm primarily interested in how rational applications of computational methods (including contemporary ML and AI) can improve how we understand and treat mental illness.</p> <p>  Email  LinkedIn  Website  GitHub </p> Featured outputs: <ul> <li>Explainable artificial intelligence for mental health through transparency and interpretability for understandability</li> <li>Model development for bespoke large language models for digital triage assistance in mental health care</li> <li>Realising stratified psychiatry using multidimensional signatures and trajectories</li> </ul> Sam Osian <p>PhD Student in Health Data Science</p> Research interests: <ul> <li>Natural language processing</li> <li>Coronial data</li> <li>Suicide prevention</li> </ul> <p>I am a PhD student working at the intersection of open data, open source technology, and suicide prevention. My current research interest centres on how data from coroners\u2019 inquests can be used to identify and respond to preventable deaths more effectively. I'm particularly interested in how advances in large language models are opening up new possibilities for analysing text at a scale and depth that simply wasn\u2019t possible before.</p> <p>  Email  LinkedIn  Website  GitHub </p> Featured outputs: <ul> <li>Automating Thematic Review of Prevention of Future Deaths Reports: Replicating the ONS Child Suicide Study using Large Language Models</li> </ul> \u00d7"}]}

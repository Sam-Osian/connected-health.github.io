## B

#### Bayesian Reasoning

Also called Bayesian inference or probabilistic reasoning, it is a means of assessing probability to incorporate new information with the most accuracy. It uses a theorem to adjust initial beliefs based on the new information.

<br>

#### Big Data

Refers to large data sets that can be studied to reveal patterns, trends, and associations.

<br>

#### Byres Community Hub

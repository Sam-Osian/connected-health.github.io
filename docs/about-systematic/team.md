## SysteMatic Core Team
Reviewers requested detail about community psychiatry representation: our core team includes two community-facing psychiatrists and the co-directors of the NIHR [Mental Health Research for Innovation Centre](https://www.mric.uk) who also have leadership positions in the [NHS partner mental health trust] (https://www.merseycare.nhs.uk). 

## Developing and Training Early Career Researchers (ECRs)
From Stage 1 we have enabled ECRs to pursue MLTC research (e.g. Driver project P4 is led by a clinical academic nurse with a new grant in MLTC data science from Stage 1 work), and in Stage 2 we will provide support for ECRs to take the lead on academic publications and be involved as co-investigators on subsequent grant applications through mentorship and buddying with experienced team members. We have budgeted for ECRs to travel and meet as a community, developing careers around MLTC challenges and have a track record of world leading [capacity building in MLTC research](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/doctoraltraining/multimorbidity). 

Another reviewer asked about the lead applicant’s MLTC research – this includes writing a book chapter on the need for MLTC systems engineering in 2009 [1](#refs) and founding [CHIL](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/chil) to address major population health challenges including MLTC with interdisciplinary research. A further reviewer asks about policy influence: we have a track record of policy research ranging from widely-cited equity work on the North-South divide to data/digital/systems policies such as starting the #DataSavesLives movement, delivering [Connected Health Cities](https://www.chc-impact-report.co.uk) and current work on [networking learning health systems](https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/135499/pdf/).

# WS3 Rapid Evaluation and System Learning

**Context**: Current models of innovation in healthcare are slow, linear and siloed – one disease and one innovation at a time – ignoring the complexity of MLTCs and care systems. Our approach offers cyclical rapid testing of different aspects of a solution’s feasibility in a whole system context. It is designed to promptly pull through practical solutions linked to needs identified in commissioning and in quality improvement work across providers of component LTC care for people with MLTCs – a learning system.

**Aims**: 
  1. Iteratively co-identify opportunities for innovation, driven by patient and NHS priorities with a critical mass of stakeholders.
  2. Disrupt linear, slow and fragmented innovation by combining agile, iterative design with rapid, holistic feasibility evaluation to produce robust, trial-ready solution designs.

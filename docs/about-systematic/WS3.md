# WS3 Rapid Evaluation and System Learning

**Context**: Current models of innovation in healthcare are slow, linear and siloed – one disease and one innovation at a time – ignoring the complexity of MLTCs and care systems. Our approach offers cyclical rapid testing of different aspects of a solution’s feasibility in a whole system context. It is designed to promptly pull through practical solutions linked to needs identified in commissioning and in quality improvement work across providers of component LTC care for people with MLTCs – a learning system.

**Aims**: 
  1. Iteratively co-identify opportunities for innovation, driven by patient and NHS priorities with a critical mass of stakeholders.
  2. Disrupt linear, slow and fragmented innovation by combining agile, iterative design with rapid, holistic feasibility evaluation to produce robust, trial-ready solution designs.

## Evaluation of Public Involvement Activities
We intend to use an impact log based on the Public Involvement Impact Assessment Framework to capture information continuously, as in Stage 1. The use of the Cube framework [1](#refs) (as suggested by reviewers) has been discussed by our public advisors: there was concern over possible fees for the online tool and accessibility for the public – but we will use the Cube principles. The PPIE impact assessments from Stage 1 and the changes to plans that resulted from patients and public advisors are detailed in our digital commons under People Insights [1]. The videos here bring alive how these key members of our team co-created the patient/journey maps core to Stage 2. We will continue this video diary approach combined with impact logging in Stage 2.

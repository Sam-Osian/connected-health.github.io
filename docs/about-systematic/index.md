# About the SysteMatic project
[SysteMatic](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/research/seismic-systematic/) brings together researchers from the Universities of Liverpool and Glasgow to develop a plan to design and engineer health systems for people living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC). 

## Context
In the UK, approximately one in three people experience the challenges of living with multiple long-term health conditions, and this figure continues to rise. It is projected that by 2035, over two-thirds of the UK's population aged 65 and above will be affected. 
<br><br>
Living with MLTC significantly impacts a personâ€™s quality of life, leading to increased care requirements and a higher risk of early death.  MLTC affects people across all communities, but those facing socioeconomic disadvantages are affected 10 to 15 years earlier. 
<br><br>
Liverpool and Glasgow both have disadvantaged communities with high levels of MLTC, challenging our NHS and wider health and care systems.

## Aims and objectives
SysteMatic will lay the groundwork for a full-scale project to improve care for people with MLTC.
<br><br>
We aim to deliver an action-ready plan for transforming MLTC prevention and care through an Innovation Hub. Our Hub will be co-designed by people with lived experience of MLTC, practitioners, academics and industry partners in Liverpool and Glasgow. Planning will build on research into mental-physical health interdependence across the lifecourse, and on mobilisation of big data and technology validation in health & care systems that serve deprived populations in Liverpool and Glasgow.
<br><br>
Together, we will identify, prioritise and co-design a programme of work focused on key challenges to health and care systems. We will collaborate with others where our shared aims align, and concentrate on three groups that Liverpool and Glasgow already have initiatives in front-line services to build on:

1.	Children and families facing stressful circumstances and environmental challenges that could lead to health issues such as child mental health problems, obesity and asthma
1.	People in working life who use mental, physical or social care services, especially where there is poorly joined-up care
1.	Older people with MLTC who are not yet defined as frail, where preventative measures could improve outcomes.
This programme will develop new ideas for technologies, service changes and pathways across services to improve person-centred care equitably.

## Partners
Researchers are based at The University of Liverpool and University of Glasgow. We care deeply about co-developing recommendations to ensure that they are patient centred so work closely with public patient and carer representatives. 

## Funding 
This study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under its Systems Engineering Innovation hubs for Multiple long-term Conditions (SEISMIC) Programme (NIHR157712).

# P2: Preventing Crisis
P2 focuses on preventing and minimising the impacts of crises in MLTCs. In Stage 1, we
identified multi-faceted, intersectional and contextual crises – many of which sit outside the health and social care system. These crises could lead to: 

  1. development and accrual of new physical/mental LTCs and acceleration and worsening of existing LTCs;
  2. failure to seek/pursue/receive appropriate care;
  3. neglect
  4. complications including a further crisis of health (e.g. emergency hospital
admissions), housing (e.g. loss of secure accommodation), or employment (e.g. inability to continue working) all of which contribute to adverse outcomes. Such crises adversely impact quality of life and health of individuals and households, and place additional pressures on health and care systems.

Our Stage 1 findings show that those with the most [extreme and diverse contextual life challenges](./people-insight/persona-set.md) are at higher risk of crises. Their life and health trajectories are adversely affected by negative downward spirals and require support/intervention to regain equilibrium. Without equitable support, they risk further/compound crises. There is a growing body of work using data and technology innovations to predict and prevent health crises, for example machine learning with multimodal data from telehealth/care technologies. However, these tend to take a single-condition, health-only focus. Our systems approach will link a range of civic data to provide a holistic perspective on a broad range of crises. We will take a novel approach to defining MLTCs as a multiplicity of LTCs present in a unit –
comprising an individual or a household. This is well-aligned with policies in Liverpool and Glasgow where commissioners are looking at the needs of complex households (for pathfinder schemes).

## Context
### Defining MLTCs and Describing Our Local Populations
We have undertaken extensive research to understand the patterns of MLTC combinations in our populations and their effects on health-related quality of life. Our Stage 1 project generated actionable population insights from re-usable NHS data assets in Liverpool and Glasgow to ensure our innovation hub is tailored to our populations’ needs. 

From these, we arrived at the common MLTC phenotypes described in our Stage 2 bid and the data supporting these can be found on under [Health Intelligence](./health-intelligence/index.md). We were, for example, able to show the importance of combined mental/physical and painful conditions in those attending unscheduled care. These combinations were also identified repeatedly and reported to be the most troublesome, throughout participatory research with community groups.

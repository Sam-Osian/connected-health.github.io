# WS1 Health Citizenship & Innovation

**Context**: Health citizenship is the active, meaningful and equitable involvement of people with lived experience of living with or caring (in a professional or lay capacity) for people with MLTCs. Citizenship in this project aims to integrate experiences and viewpoints of lived experience end-user perspectives at the centre of the design and delivery of innovations. 9 It will cultivate a system that enables members of the public and potential users of an innovative solution to be involved in its underpinning research, design and evaluation – to a degree of their choosing. This might involve: participating in community events; capacity building through training to understand elements of research; joining a network of public advisors; being mentored by an experienced public advisor to increase confidence in PPIE participation; or participating in co-creation/-design processes as potential end-users

**Aims**: 

## Defining MLTCs and Describing Our Local Populations
We have undertaken extensive research to understand the patterns of MLTC combinations in our populations and their effects on health-related quality of life. Our Stage 1 project generated actionable population insights from re-usable NHS data assets in Liverpool and Glasgow to ensure our innovation hub is tailored to our populations’ needs. From these, we arrived at the common MLTC phenotypes described in our Stage 2 bid and the data supporting these can be found on our digital commons under [Health Intelligence](../health-intelligence/index.md). We were, for example, able to show the importance of combined mental/physical and painful conditions in those attending unscheduled care. These combinations were also identified repeatedly and reported to be the most troublesome, throughout participatory research with community groups.

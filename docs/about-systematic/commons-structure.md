## Structure of the commons  
This site is a living resource, meaning the content is constantly being updated, revised and refined. At present, the site is organised according to the design co-operative approach we are adopting during the development phase. The navigation bar from left to right approximately follows the stages of the SysteMatic project as outlined below.

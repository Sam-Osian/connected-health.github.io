# Navigating the commons

This site is a living resource, which we are adding to throughout the development process, meaning the content is constantly being updated, revised and refined. 

## Site structure
At present, the site is organised according to the process we are adopting during the development phase. The navigation bar from left to right approximately follows the project stages chronologically.

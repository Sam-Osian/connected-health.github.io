# SysteMatic Phase Two
The content of this digital commons documents processes and outputs from Phase One, a UKRI SEISMIC development bid awarded to the Universities of Glasgow and Liverpool in 2023.  

This branch of the digital commons lays out our plans for Phase Two, which is currently under consideration for funding.

## Project Organisation, Work Streams and Driver Projects
![1](../assets/systematic-diagram.png)

Our proposal for the full, 50-months SysteMatic systems engineering hub is composed of three work streams:
  1. Health Citizenship and Innovation
  2. Data and AI Connected Care
  3. Rapid Evaluation and Systems Learning

... that serve and support five "driver projects" organised around needs, priorities and applications identified in Phase One, namely:

  1. Preventing Medication Harms
  2. Preventing Crisis
  3. Living with Mental and Physical Illnesses
  4. Technologies for Clinicians Integrating Care
  5. Technologies for Patients Using Care Networks

# P1 Preventing Medication Harm

The study will follow the MRC framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions, ensuring a robust, iterative, and co-designed approach to identifying, evaluating, and implementing patient-facing technologies (PFTs) for medication review (MR) preparation and prescribing optimisation in people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) and polypharmacy. Our methodology integrates scoping, rapid evaluation, feasibility testing, and stakeholder engagement to assess the acceptability and impact of PFTs within clinical practice. 

### 1. Scoping Workshops 
**Objective**: To engage with patients, carers and healthcare professionals to explore perceptions, usability, and barriers to adoption of PFTs that may support MR. 

**Methodology**: 

  * **Participant recruitment**: Individuals aged 18+ with mental and physical MLTCs and prescribed more than 5 regular medications, recruited via clinical networks, patient advocacy groups, and community organisations. 

  * **Workshop structure**: 
    * Workshop 1: Focus groups with patients and carers to explore experiences with medications, challenges in MR, and potential benefits of PFTs. 
    * Workshop 2: Professionals and system-level stakeholders to identify priorities for MR optimisation and assess technological readiness. 
    * Workshop 3: Joint co-design session to map patient priorities and technological opportunities. 

  * **Data collection**: Audio-recorded discussions, thematic analysis of transcripts using NVivo. 
  * **Output**: A prioritised list of medication-related concerns and requirements that PFTs should address. 

### 2. Rapid Evidence Synthesis 
**Objective**: To map existing PFTs and their applications in MR preparation and actioning, assessing adaptability and scalability. 

**Methodology**: 
  * **Umbrella review**: Systematic search of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, IEEE Xplore) for reviews on PFTs supporting medication optimisation. 
  * **Systematic review of primary studies**: Where evidence gaps exist, targeted searches for empirical studies evaluating patient-facing MR technologies. 
  * **Inclusion criteria**: 
    * Population: Adults with co-existing mental and physical health conditions
    * Intervention: Digital technologies designed to aid medication self-management, MR preparation and prescription optimisation from both clinician and patient perspective
    * Outcomes: Patient engagement, usability, effectiveness in medication concordance and optimisation. 

  * **Data extraction & synthesis**:
    * Standardised data extraction form capturing study design, PFT functionality, reported effectiveness, and implementation barriers.
    * Visual mapping of evidence to illustrate PFT scalability, adaptability, and gaps in knowledge. 

  * **Stakeholder ranking**: PPIE members and clinical experts will rate and rank PFTs based on feasibility and potential impact. 

### 3. Feasibility Study 
**Objective**: To test the acceptability and implementation potential of selected PFTs in real-world settings. 

**Study Design**: Prospective observational feasibility study using a mixed-methods approach. 
**Methodology**: 
  * **Participant recruitment**: 
    * Adults aged 18+ with mental and physical MLTCs, prescribed ≥5 medications.
    * 10 participants per group for short-term feasibility testing (2-4 weeks).
    * 20 participants per group in extended feasibility trials (6-12 weeks). 

  * **Intervention**: Patient-prioritised PFTs, including:
    * Wearables (e.g., BP, pulse, oxygen saturation, ECG monitoring including QTc interval).
    * Ambient sensors (e.g., sleep, fall risk monitoring).
    * Conversational AI (e.g., symptom tracking, medication experience reporting). 

  * **Comparator**: Standard care. 
  * **Outcome measures**:
    * **Primary**: Acceptability, usability, equitable uptake, engagement levels.
    * **Secondary**: Accuracy of data collected, impact on MR preparation and actioning.
    * **Process evaluation**: Semi-structured interviews with participants and healthcare professionals to explore experiences, barriers, and facilitators. 
  * **Analysis**: 
    * Quantitative: Descriptive statistics (engagement metrics, concordance rates), comparative analysis where appropriate. 
    * Qualitative: Thematic analysis of participant interviews, triangulated with usage data. 

  * **Iterative testing**: 
    * Cyclical refinement of PFT-assisted MR preparation tools based on user feedback. 
    * Technologies demonstrating high acceptability and engagement will progress to larger-scale feasibility testing.

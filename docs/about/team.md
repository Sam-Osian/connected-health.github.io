      <h5>About:</h5>
    <p>After training as a computer scientist, I worked in computational modelling of language followed by a spell in experimental cognitive science and psychophysics. After retraining in medicine, I completed core and higher training in psychiatry as an NIHR academic clinical fellow, then lecturer. I'm primarily interested in how rational applications of computational methods (including contemporary ML and AI) can improve how we understand and treat mental illness.</p>

    <h5>Research interests:</h5>
    <ul>                      <!--Set research interests-->
      <li>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and antipsychotic medications</li>

  <div class="team-bio">    <!--Short bio, ~80 words-->
      <h5>About:</h5>
    <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Primary Care and Mental Health at the Department of Institute of Population Health, with a PhD in Statistics from the Department of Mathematics, University of York. My current research focuses on analysing large-scale longitudinal electronic health records to investigate CVD risk among individuals treated with antipsychotic medications.</p>
    <p>My research interests lie in statistical methodologies for big data and predictive modelling. I am deepening my expertise in areas such as survival analysis, causal inference, and joint modelling. My academic background spans mathematical statistics, computational modelling, and health data science, and I am passionate about contributing to collaborative research at the intersection of clinical epidemiology and data analytics.</p>
    <p>I am currently working on the PreCAP project, which uses linked CPRD primary and secondary care data to model cardiovascular risk in individuals prescribed antipsychotic medication.</p>

  <p class="team-title">PhD Student in Health Data Science</p> <!--Job title-->
  <div class="team-interests">
    <h5>Research interests:</h5>
    <ul>                      <!--Set research interests-->
      <li>Natural language processing</li>

  <div class="team-bio">    <!--Short bio, ~80 words-->
      <h5>About:</h5>
    <p>I am a PhD student working at the intersection of open data, open source technology, and suicide prevention. My current research interest centres on how data from coroners’ inquests can be used to identify and respond to preventable deaths more effectively. I'm particularly interested in how advances in large language models are opening up new possibilities for analysing text at a scale and depth that simply wasn’t possible before.</p>

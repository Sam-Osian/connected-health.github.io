# Overview

The complexity of MLTC over time, place and person risks ‘boiling the ocean’ unless research questions are focused. To avoid this, we are focusing on 3 strategic population segments: [**children and families**](docs/key-populations/children-and-families.md), [**working lives**](docs/key-populations/working-lives.md), and [**pre-frailty**](docs/key-populations/pre-frailty.md).

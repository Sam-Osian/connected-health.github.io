# Children and Families
The children and families population segment looks at psychosocial and environmental challenges with lifetime impacts. It focuses on toxic stress in families (parents and children) causing childhood adversity, neurodevelopmental disorders (ADHD/ASD, intellectual disability) and positive and negative risk behaviours (including sport/accidental trauma, sedentary lifestyle, self-harm, and substance use).

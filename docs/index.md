# Welcome to the SysteMatic Digital Commons


**What is the SysteMatic Digital Commons?**  

- A place to share outcomes and updates from the SysteMatic project. This includes resources (methods, tools, models, reports & more) focused on applying systems engineering to improve health and care for people living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC) equitably. 
- The goal is to support collaboration, conversation and learning about systems approaches for MLTC.
- This site is a living resource, which means the content is constantly being updated, revised, and refined.

<br>

**Who is it for?**  
Our resources are primarily aimed at academic researchers and professionals who are interested in systems approaches for MLTC.

**Navigating the commons**  
At present, the site is organised according to the process adopted during the [SysteMatic development phase](about-systematic/development-stage.md).

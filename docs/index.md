## About the Connected Health Group (CHG)

Our group is based in the [Department of Primary Care and Mental Health (PCMH)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/about/primary-care-and-mental-health/) at the University of Liverpool's [Institute of Population Health](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/).

The CHG is an open, diverse and informal group providing a forum for clinicians and academics from across PCMH to meet and support each other through exchange of ideas, resources and methods.

## Our Core Aims
-   We are deliberately disease- and specialty-agnostic: our members are data scientists, general practitioners, psychologists and psychiatrists.
-   We lean on expertise from our colleagues in the Institute of Population Health's [Department of Health Data Sciences](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/about/health-data-science/) and the University's [Civic Health Innovation Labs](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/civic-health-innovation-labs/).
-   We focus on translational applications of data, digital health technologies and data science both vertically (across the primary- and secondary-care divide) and horizontally (bridging between physical and mental health care) to improve healthcare.

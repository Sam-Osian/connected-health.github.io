# Welcome to the SysteMatic Digital Commons
<br>
<br>
## What is the SysteMatic Digital Commons?
The Digital Commons is a platform to:

- Share outcomes and updates from the SysteMatic project. This includes resources (methods, tools, models, reports & more) focused on applying systems engineering to improve health and care for people living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC).Â 
- Support collaboration, conversation and learning about systems approaches for MLTC.
<br>
<br>
## Who is it for?
Resources on the digital are primarily aimed at academic researchers and professionals who are interested in systems approaches for MLTC.
<br>
<br>
## How is it organised?
This site is a living resource, meaning the content is constantly being updated, revised and refined. 
<br>
<br>
At present, the site is organised according to the design co-operative approach we are adopting during the development phase. Following the navigation bar from left to right approximately follows the stages of the SysteMatic project as outlined below.

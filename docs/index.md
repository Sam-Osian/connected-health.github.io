# Welcome to the SysteMatic Digital Commons

A platform to:

- Share outcomes and updates from the SysteMatic project.
- Support collaboration, conversation and learning about the application of systems approaches to improve health and care for people living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC).

This site is a living resource, meaning the content is constantly being updated, revised, and refined. At present, the site is organised as follows:

- **Design Co-operative:** SysteMatic is a co-operative of people and disciplines working across three working groups studying systems, people and intelligence. This section includes information about the design co-operative approach, as well as updates and resources from each working group.
- **Key Populations:** SysteMatic focuses on 3 population segments across the lifecourse: children and families, working lives, and pre-frailty. This section provides information, updates and resources from our work with each population.
- **Systems Science:** SysteMatic adopts 3 orders of MLTC systems science: optimisation, innovation and transition. Information about each can be found in this section.

# **Welcome to the SysteMatic Digital Commons**

## What is SysteMatic? 
The SysteMatic project brings together researchers from the Universities of Liverpool and Glasgow, in partnership with patients, public, practitioners, and industry partners, to develop a plan to design and engineer health systems for people living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC). This work is supported by funding from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Systems Engineering Innovation hubs for Multiple long-term Conditions (SEISMIC) scheme. The development phase runs from July 2023 - December 2024, at the end of which we will apply for a full-scale Innovation Hub.

## What is the SysteMatic Digital Commons?
The Digital Commons is a platform to:
- Share outcomes and updates from the SysteMatic project. This includes resources (methods, tools, models, reports & more) focused on applying systems engineering to improve health and care for people living with MLTC.Â 
- Support collaboration, conversation and learning about systems approaches for MLTC.
- Serve as a living resource, with content continuously updated, revised, and refined.

## Who is the SysteMatic Digital Commons for?
Resources are primarily aimed at academic researchers and professionals who are interested in systems approaches for MLTC.

## How is the SysteMatic Digital Commons organised?
This site is a living resource, meaning the content is constantly being updated. At present, the site is organised according to the design co-operative approach we are adopting during the development phase:

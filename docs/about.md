# About the SysteMatic Project
SysteMatic brings together researchers from the Universities of Liverpool and Glasgow to develop a plan to design and engineer health systems for people living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions (MLTC). 

This work is supported by funding from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Systems Engineering Innovation hubs for Multiple long-term Conditions (SEISMIC) scheme. The development phase runs from July 2023 - December 2024, at the end of which we will apply for a full-scale Innovation Hub.
## How is it organised?
This site is a living resource, meaning the content is constantly being updated, revised and refined. At present, the site is organised according to the design co-operative approach we are adopting during the development phase. Following the navigation bar from left to right approximately follows the stages of the SysteMatic project as outlined below.

# Problem co-prioritisation canvas

![Prioritisation framework](../assets/prioritisation-framework.jpg)

:material-download: [Prioritisation framework template](../assets/problem-prioritisation.md){target="_blank"}  

## Overview 

In addressing complex, systemic problems, it is crucial to intervene at multiple levels. Instead of seeking single 'problem solutions’, the focus should be on multiple points of intervention that collectively steer the system in the desired direction, being aware that no static ‘solution’ is possible to a living evolving web of interconnected problems. The problem prioritisation canvas consists of 2 axes for exploring *where* (relating to health system building blocks) and *how* (relating to 3 orders of MLTC systems science) to intervene in a system. 

## Application & use 

The canvas can be used for:

- Introducing & testing diverse strategies (diversified problem tackling)
- Progressing a stream of parallel and prioritised briefs (multiple problems tackling)
- Targeting multiple system building blocks in each brief (linked problems and building blocks tackling)

## Results & insights

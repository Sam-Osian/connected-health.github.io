# Problem co-definition 

Numerous interrelated problems in MLTC systems were identified through qualitative and quantitative research in stage 1. These were synthesised through an iterative visual mapping process, which led to the development of a living interactive map. The map sorts problems into three broad categories (people & place, system design, MLTC needs), and maps the connections between them. This map is designed to evolve over time, allowing for the addition or modification of problems and their relationships as new insights emerge or the system changes.

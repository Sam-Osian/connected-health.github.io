# Objective
In this work package, we attempted to pull together and organise examples from the literature that situate *system engineering for healthcare* (for example, the [Engineering Better Care](https://raeng.org.uk/media/wwko2fs4/final-report-engineering-better-care-version-for-website.pdf) report) in the broader context of [design methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_methods), [learning health systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_health_systems) and [systems science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science) more generally.

This was particularly evident to us in our initial [development phase](docs/about-systematic/development-stage.md) meetings

# 3 orders of MLTC systems science
Our cooperative of disciplines includes systems modelling, systems engineering, systemic design, clinical research, public health research, and health and care commissioning and provision.  
<br>
We apply three orders of systems science to health & care systems, distinguished by: a) how they define a system;
b) the associated research methods; and c) the tools, frameworks and techniques.

[**1) 1st-Order: Optimisation**](optimisation.md) optimises discrete components with clear boundaries, quantified inputs/outputs, crude ontologies and a governing process with feedback and error correction. For example, feedback to GPs on their potentially harmful prescribing of antipsychotics and interacting drugs with no wider context.

[**2) 2nd-Order: Innovation**](innovation.md) is the mainstay of systems engineering in healthcare. Modelling is ontological, but tolerates ill-defined boundaries, uncertainty and unknowns, and may adopt simulation methods, or statistical process control. For example, modelling the potential impacts of a weight management clinic/service for people taking antipsychotic medication, after psychotic symptoms are controlled.
   
[**3) 3rd-Order: Transition**](transition.md) extends to soft systems with porous boundaries, nonlinear behaviours, and contextual sensitivity. Key approaches are participatory; Patient and public engagement and involvement (PPIE) with practitioner co-design, action research, systemic design, and transition design. This approach suits transitioning from single condition/pathway/service optimisation to integrated MLTC approaches. For example, transitioning from NHS weight-management referral to a package of wider
cardiovascular risk reduction and social support/prescribing for people taking antipsychotic medication.

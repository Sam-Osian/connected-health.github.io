# MLTC systems science
Our cooperative of disciplines includes systems modelling, systems engineering, systemic design, clinical research, public health research, and health and care commissioning and provision.  
<br>
We apply three orders of systems science to health & care systems, distinguished by: a) how they define a system;
b) the associated research methods; and c) the tools, frameworks and techniques.

[**1) 1st-Order: Optimisation**](optimisation.md) optimises discrete components with clear boundaries, quantified inputs/outputs, crude ontologies and a governing process with feedback and error correction. For example, feedback to GPs on their potentially harmful prescribing of antipsychotics and interacting drugs with no wider context.

[**2) 2nd-Order: Innovation**](innovation.md) is the mainstay of systems engineering in healthcare. Modelling is ontological, but tolerates ill-defined boundaries, uncertainty and unknowns, and may adopt simulation methods, or statistical process control. For example, modelling the potential impacts of a weight management clinic/service for people taking antipsychotic medication, after psychotic symptoms are controlled.
   
[**3) 3rd-Order: Transition**](transition.md) extends to soft systems with porous boundaries, nonlinear behaviours, and contextual sensitivity. Key approaches are participatory; Patient and public engagement and involvement (PPIE) with practitioner co-design, action research, systemic design, and transition design. This approach suits transitioning from single condition/pathway/service optimisation to integrated MLTC approaches. For example, transitioning from NHS weight-management referral to a package of wider
cardiovascular risk reduction and social support/prescribing for people taking antipsychotic medication.

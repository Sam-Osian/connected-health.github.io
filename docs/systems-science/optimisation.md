# Definition
A 1st-Order approach treats a system as a concrete ontological entity (i.e. a collection of components and dependencies that exists “in the real world”) that can be captured by a formal model – at a single level of abstraction – that is amenable to description and analysis using research methods from the formal sciences and engineering (e.g. operations research, mathematical programming/optimisation and control theory). 1st-order approaches emphasise the regulation/control of a system’s output by feedback and error correction (as in industrial control) generally using analytically-tractable – often deterministic – and mature mathematical methods. 

1st-Order approaches are suited to **optimising components** of larger healthcare systems where:

  * the boundaries of a given model are well-circumscribed
  * inputs, outputs and processes can be captured quantitatively, precisely (i.e. without significant unmeasurable uncertainty)
  * sources of natural variation or noise admit well-understood formalisms (e.g. can be modelled as a random variable, with a convenient parametric distribution)
  * and the interactions (and dependencies) between components can be described using well-understood mathematics see for example, stochastic queueing models for bed management (Griffiths, Knight, and Komenda 2013).

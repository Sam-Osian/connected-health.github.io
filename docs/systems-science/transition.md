# Definition
3rd-order approaches are characterised by the broadest definition of systems theory and exemplified by soft-systems methodology and connections to design methods.


A coarse and qualitative distinction between 1st/2nd-order and a 3rd-Order approaches is that the former are “hard systems” approaches (inherting from formal sciences and engineering traditions) while the later is a “soft systems” paradigm inheriting from social sciences (Costa Junior, Diehl, and Snelders 2019). In 3rd-order approaches, a system is inherently open (rather than closed) with porous boundaries, exhibit non-linear or unpredictable behaviours (that are difficult to model using methods common to 1st- and 2nd-order approaches) and are context-dependent (Preiser 2019) – i.e. in the 3rd-order approach, systems are epistemological (rather than ontological) entities(Reynolds et al. 2016) consistent with soft-systems methodology (Checkland 2000). 3rd-Order approaches view any ‘system’ as one possible model of components and their relationships/dependencies that inextricably depend on the perspective of the agent articulating that model. A system model will therefore vary with the level of abstraction adopted, the individual modeller and the appropriate methodologies and tools will vary accordingly. Consequently, a 3rd-order approach naturally invites methodology/frameworks such as participatory design, patient-public co-design, soft-systems methdology (SSM) (Augustsson, Churruca, and Braithwaite 2019) and action research (Checkland 2012; Koshy, Koshy, and Waterman 2010; Meyer 2000) but importantly, does not exclude formal methods (Schwaninger and Grösser 2008) e.g. agent-based modelling and system dynamics (Liu et al. 2018). The emphasis on complexity as a function of unpredictable actors (people/professionals) and uncertainty that is difficult to capture using more familiar formal methods (as in 1st- and 2nd-order systems) but invite ...? Farnaz: If I’ve understood our discussion correctly : 3rd order is where design practice/theory would link in – could you furnish some text/citations and elaborate ?.

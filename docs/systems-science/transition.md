# Definition
Hieronymi (2013) provides the heuristic that "*Classical analytical problem solving works fine for isolated problems with pre-stated goals. Systemic methods, on the other hand, are especially helpful when many different stakeholders interact in a dynamic complex setting, where there is no initial consensus on the problem definition, the expected future, or a shared vision of what to reach.*". 3rd-order approaches are therefore characterised by drawing widely from eclectic theoretical orientations of "systems theory" as they are defined and discussed in a very diverse literature ranging from biology, physics and mathematics through to social sciences.  

Defining the qualitative boundaries between 1st- and 2nd-order approaches is difficult because 3rd-order approaches often use or encompass theory (e.g. concepts such as feedback and regulation, adapatation or learning, system instability and complex dynamics) and methods (e.g. mathematical and computational techniques) common to all three orders.  3rd-order approaches often use the concepts from 1st and 2nd-order approaches qualitatively rather than quantitatively or literally; for example, while a 3rd-order model might articulate the existence of negative feedback between two or more system components, we are unlikely to be able to produce a useful quantitative model that describes and makes quantitative predictions about the feedback processes using coupled differential equations or state-space models.

Approaches we have called 3rd-order are those that don't seek to optimise or necessarily innovate on an existing model of a system (for example, improving patient throughput *given* a set of existing services and constraints to be satisfied) but rather, may help transition from an existing model of healthcare to something very different and re-imagined.  This open-endedness implies that some of the resulting models or tentative proposals for a healthcare system are incompatible with how healthcare is currently understood or delivered; i.e. they may be unrealistic given the immediate and medium-term funding for acute and secondary care in hospitals.  



 Hieronymi (2013) then provides an overview of systems principles, theories and their philosophical connections and outlines "systems approaches" that help ground these principles in practice -- notably, in the familiar iterative four-stage process of "Design, Plan, Intervene, Analyse" -- for comparison, see our [MLTC-focused design process](https://systematic-nihr.github.io/transdisciplinary-synthesis-strategy/MLTC-learning-system-framework/) and the ["double diamond"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)) design process.

The overarching tenets of 3rd-order approaches are:

 * Inter- and transdisciplinary expertise
 * Theories of systems drawing from formal sciences, biology, social- and cognitive sciences
 * Taking a systems approach, inheriting from the above







A coarse and qualitative distinction between 1st/2nd-order and a 3rd-Order approaches is that the former are “hard systems” approaches (inherting from formal sciences and engineering traditions) while the later is a “soft systems” paradigm inheriting from social sciences (Costa Junior, Diehl, and Snelders 2019). In 3rd-order approaches, a system is inherently open (rather than closed) with porous boundaries, exhibit non-linear or unpredictable behaviours (that are difficult to model using methods common to 1st- and 2nd-order approaches) and are context-dependent (Preiser 2019) – i.e. in the 3rd-order approach, systems are epistemological (rather than ontological) entities(Reynolds et al. 2016) consistent with soft-systems methodology (Checkland 2000). 3rd-Order approaches view any ‘system’ as one possible model of components and their relationships/dependencies that inextricably depend on the perspective of the agent articulating that model. A system model will therefore vary with the level of abstraction adopted, the individual modeller and the appropriate methodologies and tools will vary accordingly. Consequently, a 3rd-order approach naturally invites methodology/frameworks such as participatory design, patient-public co-design, soft-systems methdology (SSM) (Augustsson, Churruca, and Braithwaite 2019) and action research (Checkland 2012; Koshy, Koshy, and Waterman 2010; Meyer 2000) but importantly, does not exclude formal methods (Schwaninger and Grösser 2008) e.g. agent-based modelling and system dynamics (Liu et al. 2018). The emphasis on complexity as a function of unpredictable actors (people/professionals) and uncertainty that is difficult to capture using more familiar formal methods (as in 1st- and 2nd-order systems) but invite ...? Farnaz: If I’ve understood our discussion correctly : 3rd order is where design practice/theory would link in – could you furnish some text/citations and elaborate ?.

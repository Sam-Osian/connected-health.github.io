# Approach
We are designing SysteMatic through three workign groups studying **systems**, **people** and **intelligence**, in a cooperative of people and disciplines including: those with lived and caring experience of MLTC, health and care professionals, scientists, engineers, designers, artists and social scientists.

## Principles
We adopt human-centred, inclusive, equitable and participatory design principles to ensure an innately patient-centred, equitable and innovative approach. Design futuring and speculative design provide ways to research and build shared future MLTC scenarios that can help to identify systems innovation and transition targets and help to form and incorporate the new technologies and tools. 

We apply three orders of systems science to health & care systems, drawing upon: systems modelling, systems engineering, systemic design, clinical research, public health research, and health and care commissioning and provision.

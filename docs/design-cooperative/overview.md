# MLTC Design Co-operative
We are designing SysteMatic through a cooperative of people and disciplines including: those with lived and caring experience of MLTC, health and care professionals, scientists, engineers, designers, artists and social scientists. The co-operative is split into three working groups studying [**systems**](systems-futures.md), [**people**](people-insights.md) and [**intelligence**](health-intelligence.md),

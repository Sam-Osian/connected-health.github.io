# People Insights

People Insights puts a diversity of patients, practitioners, and public partners â€“ including those seldom heard, at the centre of the design of SysteMatic. This involves using design and arts-based approaches to capture and consolidate lived experiences into personas, patient journeys, system maps and system failure scenarios.

# Photovoice

## Overview
Photovoice is a photography-based participatory research method where participants capture images that represent their experiences and perspectives. The Photovoice activity engaged participants in capturing images that reflected their experiences living with long-term health conditions.

## Application & use:  
Participants used their mobile phones to document their lives around specified themes that illustrated their health conditions, community supports and barriers to physical and mental wellbeing. The resulting photographs were shared in group settings, which facilitated discussions to explore the meanings behind the images.

### Why this approach?  
Photovoice is a critical tool for amplifying the voices of marginalised communities. By focusing on imagery and personal experiences, this method allows participants to represent their realities and advocate for their needs effectively.

## Results & inisghts  
Participants' photographs served as powerful conversation starters, enriching discussions about the social determinants of health within their communities. This participatory method fostered community dialogue and highlighted barriers to health access.

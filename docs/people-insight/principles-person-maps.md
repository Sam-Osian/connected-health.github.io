# Principles for person mapping

In this person mapping section, we focus on strategies for unpacking and communicating insight at the **person level**, as foundational contextual information before moving on to the [journeys](journey-maps.md) and [systems](system-maps.md) levels. This covers creating [*person maps*](person-maps.md) that provide a rich picture of individuals living with MLTC and their contexts, then moving beyond individual stories to curate a [*systemic persona set*](persona-set.md), and finally using [animation](animation.md) to bring people's stories to life.  

The following core conceptual principles underpin our approach to person mapping: 

### Dimensional
Capturing multiple layers of a person's context and experience. This includes how different aspects of personhood, health, and patienthood intersect to shape their lived reality.

### Diverse
Representing a diversity of mainstream-extreme[^1] personhood (person and context, e.g., socioeconomic status), health (e.g., complex co-occurring conditions), and patienthood (e.g., navigation and trust in or avoidance of healthcare systems). 

### Dynamic
Recognising that a person's context, health and patienthood may change over time, or in different scenarios (i.e. long-term, temporary, or situational).[^2]

### Systemic
Individuals experiences of living with MLTC are interwoven with the lives of others in their ecosystem (including family, healthcare professionals etc).

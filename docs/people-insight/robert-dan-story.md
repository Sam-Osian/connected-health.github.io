# Robert & Dan's Story

**Robert** 42, has faced a lifetime of adversity, including care experience, addiction, and institutionalisation in hospitals and prisons. He experiences anxiety, depression (for which he takes medication), gastric issues, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations and circulation problems. He has low self-worth, and views his symptoms as self-imposed, so finds it hard to prioritise himself or his health. Distrustful of healthcare providers due to stigma and past neglect, he is avoidant of medical help and medication. Robert believes it was the community facing support worker that saved him rather than the clinician or social worker. He relies on community support and sometimes borrows medication such as omeprazole and Ventolin from his mother. Robert is reconnecting with his wider family and embracing recovery. He lives with his wife and step-children. He’s discovered the support of like-minded people and having purpose is essential to keeping him healthy. Robert mostly avoids technology. He uses a pay-as-you-go phone to watch videos on YouTube and accesses a trusted recovery app promoted by his sponsor. 

**Dan**, a 33-year-old support worker from a local community organisation has become a key figure in Robert's journey. Dan first met Robert during a drop-in session and, over time, gained his trust by listening, showing up, and treating Robert as a person, not a problem. He wishes the system better understood people like Robert, and advocates for joined-up care and trauma-informed approaches within the health and care system. Dan is acutely aware of the limits of what he can do. He juggles a heavy caseload in a community sector that’s underfunded and overstretched. The emotional toll is significant, and he often worries about burnout—and about what will happen to people like Robert if these vital community services are further cut.

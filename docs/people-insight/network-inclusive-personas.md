# Systemic persona set

## Overview

The systemic persona set builds on the rich individual experiences shared in the [Person maps](person-maps.md) by creating a network of inclusive 'people stories' that highlight the diversity of individuals and experiences living with MLTC. The set intends to help shift focus beyond isolated, individual stories and highlight: 

1.	Diversity: The people included in the set represent a diversity of mainstream-extreme[^1] personhood (person and context, e.g., socioeconomic status), health (e.g., complex co-occurring conditions), and patienthood (e.g., navigation and trust in or avoidance of healthcare systems). 
2.	Temporality: While Person maps capture a moment in time, the systemic persona set reflects the dynamic nature of dimensions over time - being long-term, temporary, or situational.[^2]
3.	Interconnected stories: Individuals experiences of living with MLTC are interwoven with the lives of others in their ecosystem (including family, healthcare professionals etc).

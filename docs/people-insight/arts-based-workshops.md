# Arts-based workshops 

In Glasgow, we used participatory arts-based methods to explore the nuanced experiences of living with multiple long-term conditions, including use of healthcare. These arts-based approaches facilitated participant engagement and encouraged seldom heard voices to be included in health discussions, driving towards more equitable health policies and practices.

More information about some of the arts-based methods used in the workshops can be found on the following pages:  

- [Body mapping](body-mapping.md)
- [Visualised health journeys](visual-health-journeys.md)
- [Photovoice](photovoice.md)

Personas were developed based on qualitative data gathered from the workshops as well as interviews. You can read about them here:

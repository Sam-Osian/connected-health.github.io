# Arts-based workshops 

## Overview 

In Glasgow, we used participatory arts-based methods to explore experiences of living with multiple long-term conditions, including use of healthcare. Through the implementation of body mapping, visualised health journeys, photovoice and personas, the nuanced experiences of individuals living with multiple long-term health conditions were explored. These arts-based approaches facilitated participant engagement and encouraged seldom heard voices to be included in health discussions, driving towards more equitable health policies and practices.

More information about arts-based methods used in the workshops can be found on the following pages:

- [Visualised health journeys](visual-health-journeys.md)
- [Photovoice](photovoice.md)

Personas were developed based on qualitative data gathered from the workshops as well as interviews. You can read about them here:

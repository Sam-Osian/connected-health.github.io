# Persona set

## Overview

The persona set builds on the rich individual experiences captured in the [Person maps](person-maps.md), shifting the focus beyond isolated individual stories to illustrate a network of personas that reflect a diversity of individuals and experiences.

The persona set includes multiple stakeholders of MLTC systems including people with MLTC, their family, health and care professionals, and community organisations.  

The persona set is being revised, refined and validated through stakeholder engagement. Currently, it includes: 

| Persona     | Description                     | Further detail                 |
| ----------- |-------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Lucy, 55   | **Isolated self-manager** <br> Lives with contested conditions, no support, feels dismissed & abandoned. | [Lucys person map]() <br> [Lucy & Anitas story]()  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| Anita, 41  | **Overstretched GP** <br> Balancing person-centred care with systemic inefficiencies, heavy caseloads, and burnout. | [Lucy & Anitas story]() |
| Robert, 45 | **Stigmatised & marginalised** <br> Has faced a lifetime of adversity, including care experience, addiction, and institutionalisation. Distrust and avoidance of healthcare, and difficulty prioritising his health due to past adversity and low self-worth. | [Roberts person map]() <br> [Animation about Robert]() <br> [Robert & Dans story]()|
| Dan, 33    | **Recovery worker.** <br> Balancing workload with emotional demands, lack of resources. | [Robert & Dans story]() |
| John, 60   | **Expert patient & resilient carer** <br> Manages his own MLTC, cares for his wife and her mother. Due to bad previous experiences, he doesn’t always trust health professionals and strongly feels that the patient is an expert in their own body. Persistently challenges the system.  | [Johns person map]() <br> [John & Kathys story]() |
| Fozia, 47  | **Burnt out mum & carer** <br> Overwhelmed by balancing work, family life, and caring for her son with MLTC. Exhaustion, financial strain, and a lack of respite are impacting her physical and mental health.  | [Fozias person map]() <br> [Fozia & Mohameds story]() |

## Application & use

The persona set is produced and validated with system stakeholders. It reflects our [principals for person mapping](principles-person-maps.md):  

**Dimensional & diverse**  
(figure - sitting across the extreme-mainstream framework)   
We use a framework derived from dimensions of the person maps to consider extreme-mainstream dimensions across personhood, health, and patienthood. The lived experience personas selected represent different extremes and mainstreams across these dimensions.

**Dynamic**  
(image showing how traces on the framework may change over time)   
Recognising that a person's context, health and patienthood may change over time, or in different scenarios (i.e. long-term, temporary, or situational). For example: 

- Lucy’s fluctuating energy means some days she’s engaged in volunteering, while on others she is housebound
- Johns has been on a rollercoaster in relation to his diabetes, took a long time to accept it, was uncontrolled, now its controlled & he relates to himself & healthcare very different (patienthood changed over time)

**Systemic**  
(image interconnected stories, relating to actor map)  
The persona set includes stories from multiple stakeholders across different segments of our [MLTC systems actor map](actor-map.md). This set illustrates how these diverse perspectives—people with MLTC, their family and carers, health professionals, and community organisations—intersect and relate. It highlights interconnected stories and systemic issues across different parts of the MLTC system.

<br> 

Building on the development phase work, we will continue to refine and co-produce the persona set with PPIE partners and system stakeholders. This will incorporate views from project specific target populations. The persona set will be used as exemplars alongside stakeholder engagement to test and validate innovations.


## Insights & findings

The persona set provides insight into diverse experiences of the MLTC system, and highlights themes such as isolation, systemic disconnection, burnout in care providers, trauma and marginalisation, resilience, power and agency. 
These can help inform the development of future technologies, policies, and practices to improve healthcare delivery and support for people with MLTC.

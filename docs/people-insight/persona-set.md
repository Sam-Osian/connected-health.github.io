# Persona set

## Overview

The persona set builds on the rich individual experiences captured in the [Person maps](person-maps.md), shifting the focus beyond isolated individual stories to illustrate a network of personas that reflect a diversity of individuals and experiences.

The persona set includes multiple stakeholders of MLTC systems including people with MLTC, their family, health and care professionals, and community organisations.  

The persona set is being revised, refined and validated through stakeholder engagement, currently, it includes: 

| Persona     | Description                     | Further detail                 |
| ----------- |-------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Lucy, 55.   | **Isolated self-manager** <br> Lives with contested conditions, no support, feels dismissed & abandoned. | [Lucys person map]() <br> [Lucy & Anitas story]()|
| Anita, 41.  | **Overstretched GP** <br> Balancing person-centred care with systemic inefficiencies, heavy caseloads, and burnout. | [Lucy & Anitas story]() |
| Robert, 45. | **Stigmatised & marginalised** <br> Has faced a lifetime of adversity, including care experience, addiction, and institutionalisation. Distrust and avoidance of healthcare, and difficulty prioritising his health due to past adversity and low self-worth. | [Roberts person map]() <br> [Animation about Robert]() <br> [Robert & Dans story]()|
| Dan, 33.    | **Recovery worker.** <br> Balancing workload with emotional demands, lack of resources. | [Robert & Dans story]() |
| John, 60.   | **Expert patient & resilient carer** <br> Manages his own MLTC, cares for his wife and her mother. Due to bad previous experiences, he doesn’t always trust health professionals and strongly feels that the patient is an expert in their own body. Persistently challenges the system.  | [Johns person map]() <br> [John & Kathys story]() |
| Fozia, 47.  | **Burnt out mum & carer** <br> Overwhelmed by balancing work, family life, and caring for her son with MLTC. Exhaustion, financial strain, and a lack of respite are impacting her physical and mental health.  | [Fozias person map]() <br> [Fozia & Mohameds story]() |

Reflecting our [principals for person mapping](principles-person-maps.md), the persona set is:  

**Dimensional & diverse**
(figure - sitting across the extreme-mainstream framework)  
We use a framework derived from dimensions of the person maps to consider extreme-mainstream dimensions across personhood, health and patienthood. The lived experience personas selected represent cover the different extremes and mainstreams. 

**Dynamic** 
(image showing how traces on the framework may change over time)  
Recognising that a person's context, health and patienthood may change over time, or in different scenarios (i.e. long-term, temporary, or situational). – give story examples of how dimensions on a specific persona might change over time.
Lucy’s fluctuating energy means some days she’s engaged in volunteering, while on others she is housebound


**Systemic** 
(image interconnected stories, relating to actor map)
Stories of multiple stakeholders from across different segments of our MLTC systems actor map are included. The set includes people with MLTC, family and carers of people with MLTC, health professionals, and community organisations. And shows how some of their stories link. Different perspectives, constraints, issues on the same events.

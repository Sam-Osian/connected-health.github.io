# Persona set

## Overview

The persona set builds on the rich individual experiences captured in the [Person maps](person-maps.md), intending to help shift focus beyond isolated, individual stories by creating a network of personas that reflect a diversity of individuals and experiences of MLTC. 

Reflecting our [principals for person mapping](principles-person-maps.md):  

**Dimensional & diverse**
(sitting across the extreme-mainstream framework)

**Dynamic** 
(traces on the framework may change over time)

**Systemic** 
(interconnected stories)

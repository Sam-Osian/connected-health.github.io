## Overview  
Visual health journeys were used in workshops and the [activity books](activity-book.md). Participants constructed visual narratives that illustrated their health journeys over time by drawing a timeline of their health.

## Application & use  
Paper and coloured pens were provided, allowing participants to express key health milestones, challenges and successes visually. Through sharing these visual representations within groups, common themes emerged, providing insight into the shared struggles and triumphs of participants.

## Why this approach?  
Creating visual healthcare journeys equips seldom heard groups with a powerful medium to articulate their stories. This approach prioritises their perspectives, making their voices visible within health discourse. 

## Results & insights  
The visualisations captured significant health events and emotions, articulating the multifaceted nature of personal health experiences. The health journeys revealed that many had lived with trauma and complexity in their lives and this had negatively impacted on their health and wellbeing. By creating a visual timeline of events linked to aging and adverse childhood experiences, we were able to discuss the complexity and uncertainty of health and wellbeing.

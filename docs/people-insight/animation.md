Juggling multiple health conditions: Roberts story.
///

## Overview 

The University of Glasgow's People Insights team created a short animation to highlight the challenges faced by marginalised individuals with MLTC. It tells the story of Robert, a 45-year-old in recovery who is managing MLTCs. Voiced by a member of the public, the animation provides an authentic look at the systemic and practical barriers such individuals face, illustrating the complexities of their health journeys and broader societal impacts.

## Application & use

This animation serves to illuminate the lived experiences of those navigating complex health systems under marginalisation. Robert’s story highlights how financial hardship, transportation issues and logistical challenges with medications and appointments hinder self-care. It functions as an educational tool for healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers, fostering empathy and understanding while advocating for systemic reforms. It also serves as a platform to drive conversations about more equitable healthcare systems that address the needs of those with MLTCs.

## Results & insights

Robert’s story underscores the resource-intensive nature of managing multiple health conditions, especially for those with limited support. The animation effectively demonstrates how cumulative pressures (e.g financial/pain) can worsen health and increase vulnerability, even for individuals striving to maintain/regain control.  

The animation ends on a hopeful note, envisioning a future where innovative solutions create a more inclusive healthcare system for individuals like Robert.

# Systemic, inclusive person mapping 

## Overview 
Personas and vignettes are fictional characters/stories created to represent different users/people. They are commonly used in human-centred design processes and healthcare research to foster empathy and understanding. They provide a way to understand and represent user needs, goals and behaviours in order to guide decisions. However, traditional approaches to personas often rely on generalised archetypes that risk oversimplifying complex lived realities. Criticisms of these methods include a lack of diversity, insufficient grounding in lived experiences, and limited consideration of systemic inequities. These shortcomings can lead to personas that fail to address the needs of marginalised or extreme users, thereby perpetuating existing gaps in care and services. Moreover, they tend to depict isolated experiences, offering little understanding of the interconnected and systemic nature of multiple interrelated experiences.
<br><br>
Our aim was to share diverse, equitable and systemic real-world stories of people living in and operating within siloed systems of MLTC health and care in Glasgow and Liverpool. 
<br><br>
We developed a conceptual framework with spectrums across multiple "extremes" and "mainstreams" of person and context (e.g., socioeconomic status), health (e.g., complex co-occurring conditions), and patienthood (e.g., trust in or avoidance of healthcare systems). Adopting an equity lens, the personas emphasise how individualsâ€™ experiences are shaped by a) their interactions with others (households, communities, clinicians); b) their journeys through the healthcare system; and c) the broader context of their lives.
